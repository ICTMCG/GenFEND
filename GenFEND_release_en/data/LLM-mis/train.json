        "content": "According to a source, Jennifer Aniston is back in the dating scene after her split from husband Justin Theroux. The actress, known for her role in \"Horrible Bosses,\" is taking things slow and enjoying the process of getting to know new people. During her difficult times, Jennifer leaned on her friends for support, allowing her to heal and regain her confidence in dating. While she values love, Jennifer is currently just enjoying casual dating and not looking for anything serious. She is not rushing into falling in love and is taking her time to see where things go. Jennifer is grateful to have a supportive group of friends around her during this time. Neither Jennifer nor Justin have addressed their separation publicly since their joint statement, where they explained that the decision was made mutually and lovingly. They also expressed their intention to maintain a strong and respectful friendship despite parting ways as a couple. Their statement aimed to address the rumors and speculation that often arise in the media.",
